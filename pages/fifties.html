      Born from pain

    <p class="container">
      As fundamental as the expression of pain and sorrow itself, the blues was an 
      intimate insight into the everyday life of an African American in early 1900's 
      America. Originating from the south, the blues could by the 1920's be heard at 
      every street corner around the Mississippi delta. Accompanied by a guitar, or their 
      voice alone, skilled black blues musicians begun to migrate up the river with 
      dreams of making it big in the northern cities. It was around this time that the 
      word began to spread. The word of man so talented at the blues, that it was said 
      that his skills were acquired, in exchange for his soul, in a deal with the devil.

            Robert Johnson's 1937 song "Cross Road Blues" is considered one of the most important 
            songs in the evolution of modern western music. Johnson's pain-soaked music was later 
            embraced by the 1960s blues revival in Britain, decades after his mysterious death 
            in 1938. Along with Johnson, black blues musicians had by the 30's and 40's emerged 
            in the music scene of cities like Memphis and Chicago.

            Radio allowed groups of blues 
            musicians to express their music to a larger audience, now accompanied with a microphone 
            and electric guitar at hand. In a time where black people had to sit in the back of 
            the bus, and racial segregation permeated the American society, radio stations aimed 
            towards a black audience became central for the Afro-American culture. As the blues 
            took influence from other popular music at the time such as jazz, country and western, 
            jump blues and swing these radio stations became the cradle of the genre later know as 
            rhythm and blues (R&B).

            The R&B sound can be traced back to the black female voices of the 20's and 30's. The 
            most influential of them all, Bessie Smith's, went on to inspire voices such as Billie 
            Holliday, Aretha Franklin and Janis Joplin. Post WW2 50's America rolled around, and 
            white teenagers became increasingly drawn to the exciting sound and feel of R&B. Out of 
            fear and concern of how this music might effect their youth, racial stereotypes began 
            circulating in white communities. The idea that black men are especially driven sexually, 
            and should be kept away from teenage girls, is rooted in deep systematic racism and 
            misunderstanding. Results of this narrative , believe it or not, can be seen in the rock 
            scene for decades to come.

          As crowds grew, so did the demand for instruments that could be heard across an entire 
          venue. Although the modern microphones had been around since the early 1900's, it would take 
          another 50 years until the modern electric guitar would appear in the mid 1950's. The 
          two most popular, being the Les Paul and the Fender Stratocaster, revolutionized live 
          blues, jazz, R&B and rock at the time. The fact that these two can be seen on gigs to 
          this day, with their design largely unchanged, is a testament to their inventors talent 
          and hard work.

          The year is 1955 and the movie Blackboard Jungle premieres, depicting an interracial 
          high school friend group rebelling against school authorities. As the opening credits 
          roll, Bill Haley’s "Rock Around the Clock" can be heard and turns theaters into dance halls 
          all across America. It’s association with juvenile rebellion and urge to separate from

          had its first taste of rock and roll. And not long after, the American music scenery is

        Rock and roll legends Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley bursted onto the scene overflowing 
        with charisma and an arsenal of outrageous and provocative stage-moves. Having spend his 
        earlier years in Mississippi, Presley took both cultural and musical influences from 
        black communities, which could be heard in his music throughout his career. Berry, as many 
        other blues and R&B musicians at the time such as Albert King, Muddy Waters and Etta 
        James, was discovered by the great Leonard Chess at Chess records. Thanks 
        to his rock and roll sound, "The Father of Rock and Roll" struck big early on with his Chess records produced 
        "Maybellene". As Chuck Berry is duck-walking across the stage and Elvis’ hips are 
        gyrating to the beat of "Jailhouse Rock", the American youth was given their own voice, 
        identity and channel to explore themselves, separate from their parents generation. It 
        simply cannot be stressed enough how much these two would go on to influence both culture 
        and music in the western world
