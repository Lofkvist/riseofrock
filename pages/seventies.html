              By the 1970's, the hippie counterculture of the 60's had become mainstream. 
              Long hair, peace signs and tie dyed clothing were now popular in the 
              middle-class suburbs. Nonetheless, the problems that caused the movement was 
              far from solved, but things were going in the right direction. The women's 
              rights movement gained mainstream attention, gay rights advocates became more 
              visible in pop and racial segregation and division instead became a problem of 
              diversity.

              Diversity was more than ever evident in the music at the as punk 
              and folk, progressive rock and disco and funk all fought for - and received - attention. Every socioeconomic group of society seemed to have their

              the same predecessor; 60's rock.

              Having left the shadow of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones would go on to enjoy 
              great success throughout the 70's (and further). But contrary to the Stones 
              longevity, bands of the British blues revival such as the Yardbirds and Cream 
              had begun to break up, and former members joined new bands or went solo. 
              Guitarist Jimmy Page, who by the end of 1968 found himself as the sole remaining 
              member of the Yardsbirds, had touring dates coming up in Scandinavia. Feeling 
              an obligation to not let his fans down, Page took to seasoned performing veteran 
              and bassist John Paul Jones to assemble a squad that could finish the tour. Together 
              with vocalist Robert Plant and drummer John Bonham, the New Yeardbirds was born, 
              or as they would later be known as; Led Zeppelin.

              From 1969 to 1971 Led Zeppelin would release four untitled albums, often called 
              Led Zeppelin I-IV; considering all four are seen as some of rocks finest albums, 
              this was an unprecedented show of efficiency, hard work and dedication 
              to their craft. Their approach to marketing, releasing no singles and rarely 
              making any public appearances added to the bands mystical aura.

          While this period gave rise to songs such as "Whole Lotta Love", "Immigrant Song" and 
          "Black Dog" that defined the genre of hard rock and   psychedelia, it was an 8 minute 
          behemoth of a song that stole the show. "Stairway to Heaven" from Led Zeppelin IV, often 
          regarded as one of the greatest and most iconic song of all time, is a mashup of folk 
          music, medieval references, heavy distorted guitars and a face-melting guitar solo by 
          Page to top it off. Throughout the 70's Led Zeppelin conquered the world of rock with 
          their emphatic live performances, where Page sometimes even could be seen playing his 
          dubble-necked Gibson with a violin bow. Their immense talent in the studio and fascination 
          with foreign cultures led to songs like the riff-heavy "Kashmir", who's lyrics Plant 
          wrote while venturing through the Moroccan desert.

        As bands were pushing the limits of technology and genres at the time, rock grew into 
        more and more sub-genres. With the use of dissonant riffs and gothic touches, Black Sabbath 
        pioneered the metal genre with their 1970 album "Paranoid". Inspired by the psychedelic 
        counterculture movement of the late 60's, bands began to explore the idea of the album 
        as a self proclaimed artistic statement. The focus was turned away from pop-rock topics 
        such as romance and sexual prowess, instead addressing philosophic ideas such as religion 
        and spirituality, authoritarianism and power, mental health and existential angst; the 
        progressive rock was born.

          After having to part with the viciously creative Syd Barrett due to mental illness, 
          Pink Floyd found themselves in a musical drought in 1968, and in desperate need to 
          fill that hole. Drummer Nick Mason invited the humble yet talented David Gilmour 
          to replace Barrett as lead guitarist. Gilmour's fast improvement as a musician, studio 
          engineer and vocalist shot Pink Floyd into progressive rock stardom by 1971 with the 
          release of "Meddle". Featuring "Echoes"; a poetic 23 minute acoustical masterpiece, 
          the album was a hint of what the band was capable of.

        In the world of descriptive songwriting, few bested the Pink Floyd co-founder, lyricist 
        and bassist Roger Waters. Waters, who had lost his father in WW2 and had since developed 
        an ability to view the world in a nuanced and critical way, begun in the summer of '72 
        to assemble of songs around the concept 'what makes you insane?'. The album, initially 
        called "Eclipse", was played during their "Meddle" tour and released on 24 March 1973 
        under it's final name; "The Dark Side Of The Moon".

              As rock and roll matured, bands grew more serious about their craft, tackling 
              bigger and bigger social problems of the day. In some sense, 70's rock had 
              grown further detached from it's roots; the flower power and counterculture 
              of the psychedelic 60's. In part as a reaction to this, a different kind of 
              rocker emerged in 70's Britain who didn't want to change the world; they 
              wanted to escape it.

              Coming out of the London music scene of the early 70's, Queen first gained exposure 
              with the release of 1974 "Sheer Heart Attack" with hit single "Killer Queen" about 
              a seductive diva who enjoys the finest of lifestyles, perhaps drawing  inspiration from the writer and lead singer himself. From 1975 to 1978, the band 
              would gift the world with 4 all time albums containing "We Are The Champions", "We 
              Will Rock You", "Don't Stop Me Now" and "Somebody To Love" to name a few.

                At the end of the day, Queen's success is much thanks to their laid back, 
                curly-haired axeman; Brian May. Rocking one of the most iconic guitars of all 
                time, May's "Red Special" has blessed the world with melodic and soaring solos 
                and riffs that everyone and their mother know by heart and have danced and sung 
                their soul out to.

                In true glam fashion, Queen was all over the place genre-wise, and has struck 
                world wide hits in every one imaginable. In 1975, this was taken to the 
                extreme when Mercury, who had just presented a piano piece for his fellow 
                band mates, calmly announced "And this is where the opera section comes in!". 
                On the 31 October 1975 Queen releases the 6 minute single "Bohemian Rhapsody" 
                featuring a ballad section, an operatic section, topped of with one of Brian 
                May's finest hard rock performances. Collectively recognized as

            The 1985 Live Aid concert saw possibly the greatest moment of music history, 
            as Queen and Freddie Mercury held 70,000 fans spellbound, belting out the

            Originally a British blues band, the Fleetwood Mac line-up we all know and love 
            would form in 1974 when Americans Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks joined. 
            With their sound revitalized by influences of folk-rock and pop, Fleetwood Mac 
            released their self titled "Fleetwood Mac", which reached no. 1 in United States. 
            In the midst of drug abuse, jealousy and divorce between band members, the band 
            then put out the immortal "Rumours"; each members musical and personal background 
            beautifully fused together into an all-time album. With hits like "The Chain" 
            and "Go your own way", "Rumours" is one of the highest selling 
            albums of all time at around 40 million.

            put on a hard rock show all throughout the 1970's. The Boston natives made a name 
            for themselves early on with their self-titled debut album, featuring "Dream 'On"; 
            a masterful orchestration of piano and distorted guitars guided by the extraordinary

            With members from all different genres and backgrounds, the Eagles mastered and 
            succeeded in several musical styles from 1971 until the bands breakup in 1980. With emotion-filled 
            lyrics and a surf and country inspired guitars, the Eagles first two releases "Eagles" 
            and "Desperado" defined the country-rock. But it wouldn't be until 1976, with 
            the release of "Hotel California", that the band reached their musical and lyrical 
            climax. The album yielded two nr.1 singles, one of course being the immortal title 
            track. "Hotel California", with it's mystical lyrics, iconic intro and an absolute 
            killer of a guitar solo played by both Felder and Walsh, has earned its place in
