          The lack of experience that of independent mid 50's rock and roll labels 
          became evident when the first wave of rock and roll excitement died down. 
          By the early 1960's, music publishers specializing in mass production of 
          teen pop dominated American. The industry was now marketing singers as the 
          ideal boyfriend for the typical suburban teenage girl. Although this era 
          of "bubblegum music" gave rise to voices such as Paul Anka and Neil Sedaka, 
          the music had lost it's edge when compared to the early antics of Elvis and 
          Little Richard. The new generation was ready for someone to take the spotlight 
          of popular music. Enter four British lads with mop-tops and music would never 
          be the same again.

          On the 9th of Febuary 1964, time froze,  as 73 million Americans watched 4 
          young British men on the Ed Sullivan show revitalize rock overnight. The music 
          sounded bigger and more provocative than ever, as if picking up where Elvis 
          had left of 7 years prior. The "Fab Four", who by this point already had 
          established themselves in UK and Europe, what shot into American stardom and the 
          "British invasion" had begun.

        wholesome pop music, another British band was enjoying tremendous success on the American charts; the 
        Rolling Stones. Their rebellious and nonconformist image and electric blues 
        inspired sound became the foundation of the British blues revival.

          In the early summer of 1967 the Beatles released their eighth album titles "Sgt. 
          Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band"; a testament to their tremendous lyrical ability, 
          and evolution as a band. The album is often credited as the first concept album, 
          i.e an album where the songs collectively convey a bigger message. It broke boundaries 
          as to what a pop album is, becoming a catalyst for the flower-power movement of 
          the late 60's and 70's. Mick Jagger's flamboyant stage performances, and Keith Richards 
          fuzzy sounding guitar in the intro to "(I Cant Get No) Satisfaction" had cemented 
          them as the bad boys of rock and the Beatles antithesis. But the American response 
          to the "British invasion" would be a force to be reckoned with.

            American folk-music was a genre brewing with young talents such as Bob Dylan and 
            the duo Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel. Inspired by the Beatles, both Dylan and Simon 
            & Garfunkel shocked the folk-music establishment as they went electric and entered, 
            or according some; created the folk-rock genre. Bob Dylan's "Like a rolling stone", 
            featuring an electric guitar, went on to become his greatest hit. Simon & Garfunkel 
            would re-release their 1964 song "The Sound of Silence", now electrified and saw 
            great success. The duo enjoyed their greatest commercial success with albums 
            "Bookends" (1968) and "Bridge Over Troubled Water" (1970).

          sounds. What resulted was the bands greatest 
          success, the 1966 album "Pet Sounds"; a 36 minute classic that set new standards for 
          musical production and sophistication. It would become one of the most influential 
          albums of the 60's, encouraging the Beatles to even more experimentation, resulting 
          in "Sgt. Pepper"

          Nothing ever came as natural as a guitar in the hands of Jimi Hendrix. With his long and 
          fast fingers dancing across the fret board, Hendrix pushed the technological limits of the 
          axe. With the use of fuzz, distortion, bending and feedback he brought intensity and sexiness 
          to the rock guitar unlike anything before him. A sound that especially can be heard all over 
          the Jimi Hendrix Experience's 1967 album "Are you experienced?" which topped second on the 
          charts only behind "Sgt. Pepper".

          The Woodstock Rock festival, held in the late summer of 1969, 
          saw 400,000 people gather for "3 days of peace & music" in what was to become a highlight in 
          the hippie- and counterculture. Acts from rock and blues giants such as Janis Joplin, Creedance 
          Clearwater Revival would take the stage and most notable of them all; the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Jimi's fuzzy, 
          psychedelic yet honorable rendition of the American national anthem became a symbolic protest 
          against the unnecessary war fought in Vietnam, yet celebrating the aspects of the American life 
          worth fighting for
